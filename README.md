# <Day-Planner>

## Description

This Node.js application is run from the command-line. It will generate an HTML webpage for a software engineering team, based on the user input. The HTML webpage will display summaries for each member of the team. The summaries will include email and GitHub profiles info, name, ID and office number, etc.

Communication is an essential part of teamwork. Having an efficient way to accurately reach the right person at the right time can help projects run more smoothly. This application allows for other teams to have an easy way to reach the right member of the team, depending on their needs.

This application will help me practice constructors, polymorphism, promises, testing and classes.

## <Day-Planner>

## Description

This application allows the user to schedule events for a 5 day time frame. It contains slots for every work-day hour that can be used to store event names.
The times-slots are color-coded to represent past, present and future time-slots.

With this application I expect to learn to use the MomentJs date and time library, Jquery and Bootstrapp.
